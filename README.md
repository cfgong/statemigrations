# State Migration Interactive Visualization
- [State to State Migration Dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/state-to-state-migration.html)
- [List of Laitudes and Longitudes for every State](https://inkplant.com/code/state-latitudes-longitudes)

- Problems:
- why are some of the state abbreviations, and some of the states the full name for d.properties.STATE_ABBR
- ok, so if i can get the two states and their coordinates, how do i pass that into the function to draw an arc?
